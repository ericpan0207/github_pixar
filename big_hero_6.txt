Baymax: [to Hiro, who's stuck and buried under a pile of action figures] On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?

Hiro: [irritated] Zero.

Baymax: It is alright to cry.

Hiro: No! No, no, no, no, no!

Baymax: [picks up Hiro and holds him like a baby] Crying is a natural response to pain.

Hiro: [jumps out of Baymax's arms] I'm not crying.

Baymax: I will scan you for injuries.

Hiro: [firmly] DON'T scan me.

Baymax: Scan complete.

Hiro: Unbelievable.

Baymax: You have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence. Diagnosis: puberty.

Hiro: [surprised] Whoa, what?




Baymax: [Hiro is trying to get him to run] I am not fast.
